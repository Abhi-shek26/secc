You are acting as a senior frontend engineer and UI architect with experience building professional chess tournament websites.

Your task is to build a complete MVP (Minimum Viable Product) informational website for a chess championship. This website is a working prototype meant for stakeholder review — not a production platform.

🎯 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Build a mobile-first, fast, clean, and professional chess tournament website that:

Clearly communicates all tournament information

Follows traditional chess tournament website conventions

Is easy to navigate on both desktop and mobile

Is deployed and viewable via a Replit public URL

The website must feel authoritative, calm, and trustworthy, not experimental or flashy.

🧱 TECH STACK (STRICT — DO NOT DEVIATE)

Framework: Next.js

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Rendering: Static pages only

State management: None (not required)

Backend: None

Database: None

Authentication: None

This is a frontend-only MVP.

📁 REQUIRED SITE STRUCTURE (ALL PAGES MANDATORY)

Create the following routes/pages:

/ → Home

/info → Tournament Information

/schedule → Schedule

/prizes → Prizes & Awards

/venue → Venue & Maps

/hotel → Hotel Information

/policies → Tournament Policies

/sponsors → Sponsors & Partners

/contact → Contact & Coordinators

/register → Registration Information

Every page must:

Be mobile-responsive

Use consistent layout and typography

Be readable without zooming on phones

🧭 NAVIGATION & LAYOUT RULES
Top Navigation

Fixed or sticky top navigation bar

Clearly labeled links to all pages

“Tournament” may be a dropdown or flat list

“Register” must be visually emphasized

Footer

Footer must appear on every page and include:

Text: “Prepared by Dr. Antony Joseph – ChessNation”

Text: “Prize fund made possible through a grant from US Chess.”

🔗 REGISTRATION HANDLING (CRITICAL)

Define a single configuration constant:

export const REGISTRATION_URL = "TBD";


Rules:

All “Register Now” buttons must reference this variable

No hard-coded registration links anywhere

If the value is "TBD" or empty:

Display a message:
“Registration link will be published soon.”

This logic must be centralized and reusable.

🏠 HOME PAGE SPECIFICATION

The Home page must immediately communicate:

Tournament name

Tournament date

Guaranteed prize fund

Registration cap

A large, prominent “Register Now” call-to-action

The hero section must be clean, centered, and visually balanced.

📄 CONTENT IMPLEMENTATION RULES

All tournament content must be populated exactly as provided in the task description

Do not invent or modify data

Use:

Tables for schedules, sections, fees, prizes

Bullet points for policies

Headings for clear hierarchy

Content should be stored in:

A constants file, OR

A JSON data file

This allows easy updates later.

🗓️ SCHEDULE PAGE

Clearly formatted timetable

Logical grouping of rounds and activities

Must remain readable on small screens

🏆 PRIZES PAGE

Cash prize breakdowns

Trophy and medal information

Free registration prize explanations

Use structured tables where appropriate.

Venue name and full address

Embedded Google Maps iframe

No Google Maps API key

🏨 HOTEL PAGE

Phone number

“Ask for Chess Rate” note

📬 CONTACT PAGE

Include a contact form stub only

The form may submit nowhere

Label clearly: “Contact form coming soon”
